# Genetic-Algorithm-Project
This project uses a genetic algorithm that uses an array of bits to simulate DNA in a population of monsters. 

Each bit on the Monster's "DNA" determines which places the monster will go to. each place has a certain amount of food that will build the monsters strength. However, the places each have a danger level that reduces the monster's health and can even have traps that instanly destory a monster. The monsters optimize for most strenth without running out of health and pass their dna to the next generation after winning competitons. This process continues untill only the strongest monsters remain.
